# UHCL Kids-U Summer 2022
### Programs and Materials for Instructors
Working the UHCL Kids-U educational summer camp I was responsible for creating a curriculum to teach python, scratch, and basic game devleopment concepts to kids ranging from kindergarten to third grade.
 The simple programs in this repository formed the backbone of the exercises I did with the students each day.
